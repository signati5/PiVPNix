; This file contains the main settings for the application.
; Comments start with a semicolon (;). Do not remove the section headers [].

[LOG_TRAFFIC_SETTINGS]
; This section controls the behavior of the background monitoring script (monitor.py).

; interval_seconds: The update frequency for the background monitoring task, in seconds.
; Every X seconds, the application will check client traffic via 'pivpn -c -b' and update the log file.
; A lower value provides more real-time data but increases system load.
interval_seconds = 30

; history_size: The maximum number of historical data points to store for each client's traffic.
; This directly controls the number of bars/points shown in the traffic charts (both the main activity
; graph and the sparklines in the clients). For example, with an interval of 30 seconds,
; a history_size of 120 will show the last 60 minutes of activity (120 points * 30s = 3600s).
history_size = 120

; idle_for_size: The number of consecutive updates with zero received traffic before a client's status
; is considered 'idle'. If a client is connected but sends/receives no data for a duration of
; (idle_for_size * interval_seconds), its status will change from 'online' or 'caching' to 'idle'.
; e.g., 5 means the client is marked as idle after 2.5 minutes of inactivity (5 * 30s).
idle_for_size = 5

; not_conn_for_size: The number of *additional* updates with zero traffic after a client is already
; 'idle' before its status changes to 'offline'. The total time of inactivity before being marked
; 'offline' is calculated as: (`idle_for_size` + `not_conn_for_size`) * `interval_seconds`.
; With default values (5 + 10 = 15 updates), a client is marked 'offline' after 7.5 minutes of total
; inactivity (15 * 30s).
not_conn_for_size = 10


[FLASK_SETTINGS]
; This section contains settings specific to the Flask web application framework.

; SECRET_KEY: A secret key used by Flask to securely sign session cookies.
; This is crucial for security and should be changed to a long, random, and unpredictable string for
; any production deployment. It prevents users from tampering with their session data.
SECRET_KEY = SECRET_KEY__SECRET_KEY__SECRET_KEY__SECRET_KEY

; USERNAME: The username required to log in to the web dashboard.
USERNAME = USERNAME

; PASSWORD: The password for the specified username.
; It is highly recommended to change this from the default value for security.
PASSWORD = PASSWORD
